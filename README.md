## Techdegree Project Description
  In this project, you'll create a browser version of “Wheel of Success”, a word guessing game where players will click letters from an onscreen keyboard to try to guess a random phrase.

  Using Javascript, you’ll create an array of phrases and write functions to choose a random phrase from that array, split the phrase into letters, and put those letters onto the game board.

  Each time the player guesses a letter, you’ll need to compare the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, you’ll update the game board with the chosen letters.

  A player can keep choosing letters until they make five incorrect guesses. If the letter they chose isn’t in the phrase, you’ll remove one of the player’s 5 guesses.

  If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen will display. If the player guesses incorrectly 5 times, a losing screen will display.

  A player can guess a letter only once. After they’ve guessed a letter, your programming will need to disable that letter.
